# Valorant Shopwatcher

A simple executable written in Go to check if any of your Valorant skins in your wishlist are available! Idea totally stolen from https://github.com/PLsergent/valorant-store (please check it).

## Requirements
- Windows as OS
- A valid Riot account (without MFA enabled is preferred)
- Internet
- that's basically it...

## How to use
Just run the app, log yourself in **(we do not fetch your credentials as they are stored locally in Windows' credential manager)**, add the skins your interested in to your watchlist and wait to be notified when skins are in your shop. The app will run itself at the startup of your computer, and your shop will refresh itself at 2AM.

## Disclaimer
This app is totally unofficial and is not endorsed by Riot Games neither, it is totally possible that it will become unavailable for many reasons due to the dependencies of the app. I do not own any of the content used in the app.
